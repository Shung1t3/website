    function functionname(parameters){
    
    }
    
    Use return keyword to return values 
    animations:
    setInterval Method: function and integer as argument. clearInterval
    to cancel.

    requestAnimationFrame() Method: Takes a single function as an argument
     requests the frames and plays 
    the animation frame by frame

    isNaN = is not a number
    parseint= convert other type to integer equivalent
    parsefloat = convert other type to float equivalent

    Radix. It is a second argument for parseint that can specify what numeral system to parse to(decimal, 
    octal, hexadecimal)

    touppercase can be used to fix user inputs for answers

    casting variable. Can cast a variabkle from one type to another.
    be careful because strings could automatically cast instead of using
    mathematical precedence. Make sure you can distinguish between
    concatenaytion and numeric addition.

    Promises: for asynchronous operations. the promise can be fulfilled,
    rejected, or pending. A promise is settled when  it is fulfilled or
    rejected. Uses a callback function.

    Module: modules can be resued and have private and public sections. 
    It is larger than a class.

    The browser can operate ansynchronously using promises, this wont 
    interrupt the execution thread and computes seperately from the DOM.

    The Await function will wait until a promise returns a result to 
    continue executing asynchronous code.

    Closures mean that inner functions can access variables of outer
    functions

    AJAX: Aynchronous Javascript and XML. Asynchronous programs can 
    send and receive data without interrupting the webpage loading.

    JSON: Javascript object notation. attribute valuer pairs, human readable,
    can store parseable data. Send data from server to webpage. 
    PArse to use in "code"
