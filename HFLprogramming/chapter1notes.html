<h1>Chapter 1 Notes</h1>
<p>

    #doctype provides a lot of important information about the document. Now all you have to say is &lt!doctype html&gt.
    
    
    Meta tag tells what characters you need.
    &ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt
    
    to link a stylesheet for formatting:
    &ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="lounge.css"&gt
    
    to link an external script:
    &ltscript src="lounge.js"&gt&lt/script&gt
    to use inline script you can use a &ltscript&gt&lt/script&gt element
    
    HTML5 has added many new features. One of these includes making the use of Javascript more efficient and responsive.
    
    DOM: Document Object Model. This is an important concept that represents a model of the loaded webpage. 
    
    The browser loads your page and loads the JavaScript. The Javascript is usually executed after the DOM is loaded.
    
    API can be used through Javascript and are very useful tools. You can:
     cache local data, geolocation API, bring data from another web service, do math and computations, store cookies and preferences locally,

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
I learned a lot about the differences about HTML4.01 and HTML5. Many simplifications were added to make creating webpages easier. This includes simplifying the #doctype specification, stylesheet linking, and javascript linking.
I also learned about the Document Object Model, which is the object Javascript operates on. Finally, I learned what Javascript is used for. It is used for enabling APIs on a webpage, creating user interaction,
making a webpage more responsive, and doing computation.
